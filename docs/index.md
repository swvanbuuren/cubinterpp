# Welcome to cubinterpp's documentation!

Cubinterpp is C++ header library for cubic and linear interpolation with Python
support. Read the [introduction](introduction.md) for an elaborate explanation
as well as data requirements.

This documentation features [usage guidance](usage.md) to build and test
cubinterpp and shows how to plot the example plots of 1D and 2D interpolation
using [mlpyqtgraph](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/mlpyqtgraph). Here, you'll
also find instructions how to use the library in your own C++ program.

Mathematical background on the interpolation is found in [math.
background](theory).

The [code reference section](reference) features the actuall C++ code along with
documentation.
