# Welcome to cubinterpp's documentation!

Cubinterpp is a C++ header library for cubic and linear interpolation with
Python support. Read the [introduction](introduction.md) for an elaborate
explanation as well as data requirements.

This documentation features [usage instructions](usage.md) to build and test
cubinterpp. This also shows how to plot the exemplary plots of 1D and 2D
interpolation by leveraging
[mlpyqtgraph](https://github.com/swvanbuuren/mlpyqtgraph). Here, you'll also
find instructions how to use the library in your own C++ program.

A theoretical foundation on the interpolation algorithms is found in
[mathematical background](theory).

The [code reference section](reference) features the actual C++ code
documentation.
